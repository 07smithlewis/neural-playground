# Skirmish.py
An agent based, machine learning simulation implementing a NEAT algorithm I built using TensorFlow (I'ts based on a paper by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf)

You can try running this experiment by running Skirmish.py
(Experiment setup can be found at the bottom of that script)
